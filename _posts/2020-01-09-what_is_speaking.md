As I’ve written multiple times before on this blog, I am currently focusing on speaking English. To be as fluent as I want to be, I should define `what is fluent speaking` in my mind. Naturally, I’ve never heard that my Korean is fluent. We usually say this to those who speak a second language. If someone speaking English as his or her mother language, we would say, “Your English is fluent.” This means his or her English is clearly understood by a native.

Basically, speaking is delivering my idea to the listener. This is not only for English but also for Korean. If someone’s speaking is clear, this means she or he selects legitimate words and speaks with good intonation and organized sentence structure. It’s a good point. Even if I make a bad sentence (If my sentence has bad structure) or use improper words in Korean, I never hear that my Korean is not fluent. But English is different. If I don’t choose the proper words or make an illogical sentence, they say it’s because I am not fluent.

So now, I’m not only learning English but also learning logical sentence structure and using proper words. I think it’s quite helpful for speaking Korean too.
