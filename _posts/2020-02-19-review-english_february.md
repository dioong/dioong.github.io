I was lazy last month. I skipped the daily English email either 2 or 3 times. I think I needed some rest. But this Monday, I began practicing again.

Nowadays, I feel that my pronunciation has been improving, thanks to being diligent about reading 2 short articles aloud after listening to an audio by a native speaker every night. For now, I need to improve my speaking to sound more natural as some of my Ringle tutors have indicated that my speaking sounds “choppy”. I will keep trying to use proper words that are appropriate to the situation.

My listening skills still need improvement. Despite focusing on listening to the speakers, I still have trouble keeping up with what’s being said. This is my main concern. I asked tutors what is the best way to improve my listening skills. They suggested that I listen to podcasts and watch video clips without subtitles.

So I installed an app for listening to podcasts. To be honest, I don’t have enough time to listen to it.

I hope to write a more positive review next month.
