I was lazy last one month. I skipped daily English letter 2 or 3 times. I think I had to get some rest. But From this Monday I've started to run again.

Nowadays I feel my pronunciation has been improved, thanks to keeping routine reading 2 short articles loudly after listening to native speaking audio every night.  For now, I need to improve my speaking to be more natural. Because some of my Ringle tutors has been pointed out that my speaking sounds like choppy. And I will keep trying to use proper words that fit the situation according to the nuance.

My listening is still needed to be better. Even though I always focus to listen to speaking, I have trouble to keep tracking what they're saying. This is my main concern. I asked to tutor that There is any best way to improve listening skills. They suggest listening to podcasts and watch video clips without subtitles.

So I installed app for a podcast. To be honest, I have not enough time to listen to podcasts.

I hope I can write more positive things in next month's review.
