title: Review English in January
tags: [English]

I made goals to check how my English is improving every month on the 15th. This is my first review.

Since last year, I’ve been using [Ringle](https://www.ringleplus.com/) for tutoring. This service has been quite helpful. After every lesson, the tutor provides feedback with a score. I think this score is meaningful because it’s from a native speaker. I’ve recorded these data and make a chart, attached below, to check my improvement and to see their feedback. This would be helpful to check my flaws and improvements for English.

I also check how much I have learned English too. Last year, I had a plan for everyday of the week.  For instance, Mondays I watch Youtube and on Tuesdays I read an article. Recently, I changed this schedule because I had to explain my efforts to my colleagues. Every night, I prepared sentences to explain what I worked on. Previously, I focused on making short sentences, but now I try to explain as detailed as possible. Usually, it takes a lot of time. But once I finish, I watch Youtube or read a book.
